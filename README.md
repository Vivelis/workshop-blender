## Exercise 1: Navigating the Blender Interface

Resources [blender interface](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/interface/index.html)

- Launch Blender and familiarize with the main components of the interface, such as the viewport, toolbar, and properties panel.
- Explore the different editor windows, such as the 3D view, outliner, and properties, and understand their functionalities.
- Practice navigating and customizing the editor windows to create a personalized workspace that suits your workflow.

## Exercise 2: 3D View Navigation

- Learn essential navigation techniques in the 3D view, such as orbiting, panning, and zooming using the mouse and keyboard shortcuts.
- Experiment with different camera views and navigation modes, such as perspective and orthographic views, and local and global orientations.
- Use navigation tools, such as the fly mode and walk mode, to move around the 3D scene and explore objects from different angles.

## Exercise 3: Object Manipulation

- Create basic 3D objects, such as a cube, sphere, and cylinder, using the add menu or shortcuts.
- Practice basic object manipulation techniques, such as scaling, rotating, and translating objects in the 3D view using the manipulator and hotkeys.
- Understand the pivot point and transformation orientations and experiment with different options to control the behavior of object transformations.

## Exercise 4: Creating and Editing Basic 3D Objects

- Create a cube, sphere, and cylinder using the "Add" menu or shortcut keys.
- Practice editing basic objects in "Edit Mode" to modify their vertices, edges, and faces using selection tools, transformation tools, and basic editing operations.
- Experiment with different object creation and editing techniques to understand their effects on the geometry and topology of the objects.

## Exercise 5: Basic Transformation Techniques

- Practice applying basic transformations, such as scaling, rotating, and translating, to objects in the 3D view using the manipulator and hotkeys.
- Experiment with different pivot points and transformation orientations to understand their impact on the objects' transformations.
- Use the "Snap" tool to precisely align objects or vertices in the scene.

## Exercise 6: Introduction to Basic Modifiers

- Understand the concept of modifiers in Blender and their role in non-destructive modeling workflows.
- Learn to apply basic modifiers, such as the "Mirror" and "Subsurf" modifiers, to create symmetrical and smooth objects.
- Experiment with different settings and options of the modifiers to achieve desired results and understand their effects on the object's topology and geometry.

## Exercise 7: Applying Materials and Textures

- Create a simple 3D object, such as a cube or sphere.
- Apply a basic material to the object using Blender's material system.
- Experiment with different material properties, such as color, roughness, and metallicness, to understand their effects on the object's appearance.
- Apply a basic texture to the material using an image or procedural texture and adjust its mapping options.

## Exercise 8: Basic Texture Mapping Techniques

- Learn the basics of UV unwrapping, including marking seams, unwrapping, and adjusting UV islands in the UV editor.
- Apply a texture to a UV-unwrapped object using an image texture and adjusting its mapping coordinates.
- Experiment with different UV mapping techniques, such as planar, cylindrical, and spherical mapping, to understand their effects on the texture mapping.

## Exercise 9: Introduction to Basic Shading Options

- Explore Blender's shading options, including smooth shading, flat shading, and auto-smooth.
- Experiment with basic shading techniques, such as vertex color shading, face maps, and procedural shading, to understand their effects on the object's appearance.
- Create a basic node-based material using Blender's shader editor and adjust its properties to achieve desired shading effects.
